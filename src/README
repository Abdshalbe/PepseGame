pepse.world.trees Package - Implementation of Trees in the Game World
The trees package is responsible for the creation, management, and display of trees within the game world.
It was meticulously designed to ensure consistent and reproducible tree generation,
with a clear separation of concerns among its various components.

Different Classes in Tree Creation:
This package includes the following classes, each fulfilling a specific role in the tree creation process:

Flora: This is the central class responsible for creating trees in the game world.
It determines where trees should be planted using reproducible random generation logic based on a seed.
It creates the tree trunks (Trunk) and leaf canopies (Leaf) and adds them to the game system.
This class also handles the creation of fruits (Fruit) on the leaves and prevents tree generation within a
safe zone around the player's starting position.
Trunk: This class represents the tree trunk. It is a static,
immovable object that the avatar should collide with.
It provides a static method for creating a Block object to serve as the trunk.
Leaf: This class represents a single leaf on a tree.
Leaves have a visual representation and animate with subtle wind movements.
It also provides a static method for creating a Block object that functions as a leaf and applies animations
to it.
Fruit: This class represents a fruit that can be collected by the avatar for an energy boost.
Fruits reappear after a certain amount of time after being collected.
The class handles collision detection with the player, removing the fruit from the game when eaten,
and its subsequent reappearance.
Relationships Between Classes:
The classes in this package work together in a modular fashion:

Flora uses Trunk, Leaf, and Fruit: The Flora class is "responsible" for assembling the trees.
It calls the static creation methods in the Trunk, Leaf,
and Fruit classes to generate the individual components of each tree (trunk, leaves, and fruits).
It receives GameObjectAdder and GameObjectRemover functions in its constructor,
allowing it to add and remove objects from the world independently of the overall game system.
Leaf and Fruit are GameObjects: They inherit from GameObject (directly or indirectly via Block),
which allows the game system to treat them as renderable objects with physical behavior (collisions,
animations).
Fruit uses Flora.GameObjectAdder and Flora.GameObjectRemover: When a fruit is collected,
it uses the remover to disappear and later the adder to reappear.
This demonstrates a design pattern where objects know how to add and remove themselves through mechanisms
passed to them, rather than being directly dependent on the game manager.
Use of Design Patterns:
Yes, a specific design pattern has been utilized:

Dependency Injection: The Flora class (and also Fruit) receives its dependencies (GameObjectAdder,
GameObjectRemover, TerranGetter) through its constructor.
Instead of creating new instances of these components internally or relying on a global mechanism,
it receives them as arguments. This allows for:
Separation of Concerns: The Flora class does not need to know how to add or remove objects from the overall
system; it merely receives the capability to do so.
Easier Testing: Mocks or stubs of GameObjectAdder, GameObjectRemover,
and TerranGetter can be injected when testing the Flora class, which simplifies unit testing.
Flexibility: The implementation of how objects are added or removed can be swapped without modifying the
Flora class itself.
Additionally, the use of Functional Interfaces such as GameObjectAdder, GameObjectRemover,
and TerranGetter is a common pattern in Java 8 and later, enabling the passing of behaviors as functions,
which also supports the principles of separation of concerns and flexibility.
